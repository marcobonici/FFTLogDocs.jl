# FFTLog.jl

FFTLog is a Julia package which performs integrals involving Bessel functions, such as

```math
F(y)=\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{d x}{x} f(x) j_{\ell}(x y)\, ,
```

or Hankel transform

```math
F(y)=\int_{0}^{\infty} \mathrm{d}x f(x) J_{n}(x y)\, .
```

Actually
it can evaluate:

- Integrals with a Bessel function
- Hankel transforms
- Integrals with a Bessel derivative

In our roadmap, we aim to include also:
- Evaluation of ``C_{â„“}``'s beyond Limber approximation (WIP)
- Automatic Differentiation
- GPU compatibility
- Integrals with multiple Bessel functions

## Usage

In the remainder of the documentation, we show how to use FFTLog.jl in details. We also give
a quick introduction to the theory behind the FFTLog algorithm.
